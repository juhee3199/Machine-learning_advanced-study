hello-i-m-a-truck,"HELLO I'M A TRUCK (Bob Stanton) '71 Central Songs, BMI Hello I'm a truck You've heard songs about truck drivers many times their stories told How they pulled out of Pittsburg for six days on the road Bout the Feather River Canyon and climbin' the old grapevine That old roadhouse down in Texas and the girls they've left behind You've heard their tales of daring and I think that's just fine But if you can spare a minute well I'd like to tell you mine There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks No double clutching gear jaming coffee drinking nuts They'll drive their way to glory and they have all the luck There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks Well there he sits in that cafe drinking coffee and telling lies Prob'ly telling 'em how to talk that hill ten miles back How telling 'em how he missed a gear and that Volkswagen full of hippies Passed us like I was sitting up on jacks or how we took that curve over on 66 Han't-a been for me hanging on the shoulder we'd both wound up in the ditch If we're on time he takes the credit if we're late I get the blame Up those hills with shutters open my stacks are running flame My stack a running red light sucking diesel from the tanks I take him south and bring him back without a word of thanks So now you've heard my story and I guess it's my tough luck There'd be no truck drivers if it wadn't for us trucks There'd be no truck drivers... Look at him sipping coffee and flirtin' with that waitress And where do you think he left me that's right next to cattle truck (mooo) Why couldn't we have put me next to that little pink mack sittin' over there Gosh she's got pretty mud flaps and talk about stracked they're both chromed Well he'll be coming out in a minute and he'll get that bar And he'll go around and beat on my tires You know for two pints of diesel I'd have a flat on the inside dual Ha that fixed him I never did like the way he drives anyhow Thainks he's God's gift to waitresses he never gives 'em a tip Well I know what he's gonna do now he's gonna take out The tape cartridge of Back Owens and play it again I don't know why he don't get a Merle Haggard tape",Country

deck-of-cards,"When I first heard this song, I was a little boy growing up Down in the state of South Carolina The song had been written and recorded by a man named T. Texas Tyler The song in it's original form related to something that Happened during the second World War Last year, early in 1991, when things were going kinda crazy Over on the other side of the world, I remembered this old song And I rewrote the first part of it to fit the situation The second part of it I left like it's been all of these years Because you can't improve upon perfection I'd like to dedicate this tonight to all the Veterans To their families, their loved ones And everybody that loves this country It was a sweltering hot Sunday morning in the Saudi Arabian desert And a young soldier sat alone in his tent, deep in thought A picture of his wife and children back home in the United States Rested on a table nearby His mind began to wander across the miles Back to other Sunday mornings that seemed so long ago Now and so far away, he thought of home And he knew that when this day dawned in America His family would go to church to pray for his well-being And his safe return The young soldier reached into his bag and he took out A deck of playing cards He began to spread them out across his bunk About that time, one of his buddies came by and said ""You gonna get up a game?"", ""No,"" the soldier replied ""I'm gonna spend a little quiet time with the Lord"" ""Looks like to me you're playing cards,"" his friend said ""No, you see, I don't have my Bible and since we can't Display our religion in public, here, I brought along this deck Of cards"" and with that, the young boy started his story You see when I look at the Ace, It reminded me That there is but one God and the Deuce reminds me that The Bible is divided into two parts The Old and the New Testaments When I look at the Trey, I think of the Father, the Son And the Holy Ghost When I see the Four, I'm reminded of the four Evangelists Who preached the Gospel There was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John And when I see the Five, I think of the five wise virgins Who trimmed their lamps, there were ten of them Five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out And when I look at the Six, I'm reminded that in six days God made this great heaven and earth The Seven reminds me that on the seventh day God rested from His great work When I see the Eight, I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this old world There was Noah, his wife, their three sons and their wives And when I look at the Nine, I think of the lepers Our Saviour cleansed And nine out of the ten, didn't even thank Him And when I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on the table of stone When I look at the King It reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven God Almighty The Queen reminds me of the Blessed Virgin Mary Queen of Heaven and the Jack or Knave is the Devil When I count the number of spots on a deck of cards I find 365, the number of days in a year There's 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year There's 4 suits, the number of weeks in a month There's 12 picture cards, the number of months in a year There's 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter So you see, my friend This deck of cards serves me as a Bible As an Almanac and as a Prayer Book And friends, this story is true I know because I know that soldier",Country

And precious things are dreams onto an exile They take him o'er the land across the sea Especially when it happens he's an exile From that dear lovely Isle of Innisfree. And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops Of this great city wondrous tho' it be I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter I'm once again back home in Innisfree. I wander o'er green hills thro' dreamy valleys And find a peace no other land could know I hear the birds make music fit for angels And watch the rivers laughing as they flow. And then into a humble shack I wander My dear old home, and tenderly behold The folks I love around the turf fire gathered On bended knees their rosary is told.",Country

how-to-rest,"Go on, stack the cinder blocks in a cold sweat; Build yourself a citadel amid the foothills of regret. Though you've convinced yourself that you're safe and sound within, the thing you fear the most never need get in. But you'll miss the sun, The warmth of another's embrace. You'll need room to run, And something to chase. And thing you fear will coax you out of that unholy place, 'Cause all you ever wanted was an escape. Those of us who vow never to love again, To love again are making liars out of honest men. It's not something that you put to bed, Hang your hat and just forget. Love don't know how to rest No love don't know how to rest So darling when you're tired, you will see, there is no safe place, no sanctuary. It's all just child's play, A game of hide and seek. Don't make it harder than it has to be. Those of us who vow never to love again, To love again are making liars out of honest men. It's not something that you put to bed, Hang your hat and just forget. Love don't know how to rest No love don't know how to rest Here's the truest thing I've ever known: The heart is just a muscle, With a rhythm all its own. It doesn't stop when you decide not to move on. The heart knows nothing of love or loss. So life just keeps on ticking by, Compelled by instinct to survive, And love's the only thing worth being alive for And love's the only thing worth being alive for Those of us who vow never to love again, To love again are making liars out of honest men. It's not something that you put to bed, Hang your hat and just forget. Love don't know how to rest No love don't know how to rest",Jazz

I could not bear or face the truth Unaware of what lies ahead I could only swear to my one God For trust and hope to come My mind wonders Thoughts invincible to open space Day dreaming of my one true friend. The friend I have is my faith in God My shield of strength To carry on And, I am not afraid. I once loved the quietness Nothing, no-one, no-thing The joy lonelyness brings...

skies-of-l-a,It's so sad what we have become Beautiful days we seem to leave so undone And I don't know where we will go from here All I know is that I can't seem to see the sun Through the sky from here Everyone has a finger But they can't point me to the light It can't be that hard to find After all we're so bright I don't know if tomorrow has a day I don't know if the rays will shine my way again All I know is that I'm standing in a place where My future is like the skies of L.A. Skies of L.A. Skies of L.A. I don't know if my body can take much more We're in the line of the richest riches But my mind seems so poor Everyone has a finger But they can't point me to the light It shouldn't be that hard to find After all we're so bright I see so many visions But everyone seems out of sight This is total neglection of a light Skies of L.A. My future looks like the skies of L.A,Pop

here-s-your-warning,"Hey it's 1984, With a glimpse of what's in store, It looks like things are up to us, No talk, just action in the streets, That's what it's gonna take, No calm youth in the U.S.A. (Chorus) It's summertime, American riot! I can't complain, unless I try it! The heat is here, a teenage warning! To those who fear, here's your warning! This could be the year That we could make some people think, With smarter minds we'll hit the streets, United we must make our stand, Divided we will fall, But it's up to us to take that step (Repeat Chorus) Complacent kids, that's all they want, But if they want trouble they'll get it! Amidst years of youth unrest And now someone is pissed, right! (Repeat Chorus)",R&B

She cuts you down, you hit the ground, you and your heart of gold. They call her the love, the love rustler, yeah. They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love, love, Love rustler, ooh yeah. So I moved on up, on in to town, just to see if this rustler, if she could be found. Well lo' and behold, to my surprise, she laid a kiss on me, hotter than a brandin' iron. She came on tough, and she came on strong, She cowtied my soul, now I can't leave here alone. And when she told me to buck, I bucked, she told me to moo, I mooed. When she told to jump, I jumped, she told me to woo, I wooed. She ran her spurs into my mind, she rode me in to the ground. If I had the will or strength, I'd crawl on out of town. They call her the love, love, the love rustler. Oh yeah! They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, Love rustler, oh yeah! They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love,love, love, Love rustler, oooh! Oh, the love, the love rustler .... do you feel alright? oh yeah ....Yippy yi yi yi, oh yeah....

The end is coming, No time for running. The end is coming, No time for running now!",Rock
